## Algorand Projects

### Employee loans lending and borrowing protocol

Employee loans are exclusive financial services provided to employees of public institutions or private companies. Employee loans are low-risk instruments and are usually offered at low-interest rates. The employer takes charge of the loan repayment through agreed deductions on the borrower payslips. This application provides a decentralised, self-custodial, and permissionless protocol for employee loans on Algorand. An orchestration of smart contracts manages the loan lifecycle, including suitability checks, KYC, and payment schedules.

### TorqueVAT: A Decentralized VAT Refund Application

A decentralised application to manage TAX-free shopping in authorized merchants. The application leverages the Algorand blockchain to maintain an immutable and auditable ledger of tax-free transactions operated by authorised tourists and merchants. A smart contract keeps track of the accrued VAT and takes care of the re-payment upon receiving mutual approval between users and local authorities. This application has the potential to improve the current VAT refund process, remove long queues at airports, and mitigate the risk of fraud.

### Tutorial: Build a private instance of Algorand in a testbed

In this tutorial, I explain how to create a private Algorand network in a self-hosted testbed. This tutorial lays the ground for Algorand private networks and sidechains.

### Algorand SmartASA reference implementation

Implementation of the standard [ARC-20](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/ARCs/blob/main/ARCs/arc-0020.md) (SmartASA). It is a tokenization framework that combines Algorand's native assets (ASAs) with the composability and programmability of Algorand Smart Contracts. This reference implementation is the building block for Real World Assets tokenization on the Algorand blockchain.

Co-authored with [Cosimo Bassi](https://github.com/cusma).
