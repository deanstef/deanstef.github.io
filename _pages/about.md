I am a computer scientist with an interest in **distributed systems** and **applied cryptography**, more specifically in secure and dependable **consensus protocols**, **blockchains**, and **distributed computing**. Since 2024, I have been a researcher at the University of Salerno (IT), working on privacy-aware cryptographic protocols for blockchain applications, with Prof. [Ivan Visconti](https://docenti.unisa.it/004312/home). I am also a visiting researcher at the University of Southampton (UK) focused on blockchain testing and smart contract formal verification.

I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2022 from the University of Southampton, supported by the [Cyber Security Accademy](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/research/institutes-centres/cyber-security-academy) and supervised by Prof. [Vladimiro Sassone](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5x2mp9/professor-vladi-sassone). I also got a M.Sc. in Engineering of Computer Science awarded (*cum laude*) in 2018, from “La Sapienza” University of Rome (IT).

My primary Ph.D. research focus was about [benchmarking procedures and methodologies](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/457412/) to assess security and performance tradeoffs in modern blockchain systems and consensus protocols. As part of my Ph.D. journey, in 2018 I had the privilege to work at the [NATO](https://www.nato.int) **Office of Security** in Bruxelles (BE) as a security researcher.

## Experience

After the PhD, I held a Postdoc position at the [Cyber Security Group](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/research/institutes-centres/cyber-security) of the University of Southampton working on blockchain-based secure data sharing for Cyber Threat Intelligence. This research was carried out as part of the H2020 EU project [CyberKit4SME](https://cyberkit4sme.eu).

From 2022 to 2024 I joined Prof. [Silvio Micali](https://people.csail.mit.edu/silvio/) at [Algorand](https://algorandtechnologies.com) as an **Applied Scientist** and **Solution Architect**. I worked on several projects including the prototyping of the Algorand CoChains (sidechains), and the architecture of decentralised applications in the financial sector.

Additionally, since 2021, I have been a **board member** and **advisor** for [LayerZero Analytics LTD](https://www.lzeroanalytics.com), where I co-authored two successful grant applications received from the [SSV Network](https://ssv.network) and the [Coreum Network](https://www.coreum.com).
